## Motivation - Why learn recommendation systems? 

Recommendation systems are everywhere. Whether you're scrolling through videos on TikTok or listening to music on Spotify, there is an algorithm in the background catering content specific to your experience. These systems are one of the most important technologies behind the success of todays top platforms. For anyone interested in tech, learning how recommendation systems work is very valuable. They are useful everywhere, from small apps and startups to massive corporations as they all need to direct favourable content to their users. 

They are fantastic for beginners in the field, as they are a good first step into key areas of computer science like machine learning, data analysis and user modelling. Building a recommendation system is often the first time you will work with large amounts of data and real datasets, and experiment with different algorithms while considering performance at scale. It teaches you to combine your technical skills with user-centred thinking. 

Good recommendations will make or break a product, since users don't want to, and can't, sit and dig through all the options available to them. Apps which fail it this lose their users quickly, while those which do quickly rise to success. For example, TikTok is most renowned for its recommendation algorithm responsible for the "for you page", which hooks users and keeps them entertained and coming back for more. This led to TikTok's rapid growth to over 1.5 billion active users.

As long as people have choices, they will need help making them. Because of this, recommendation systems will always be a useful skill to have and to learn.
 
## Background – What You Need to Know Before Starting

This guide is aimed at students or self-learners who are comfortable with the basics of Python and are looking to take their first steps into applied machine learning or data-driven projects. If you've worked with lists, dictionaries, loops, and functions in Python, you're already prepared to start exploring recommendation systems. You don’t need to be an expert in statistics or deep learning, but a basic understanding of how algorithms work will help.
Some concepts which are useful to know before starting are:
- Vectors and similarity - Understanding how we represent things like songs, users, or movies as numerical vectors is at the heart of recommendation algorithms. Knowing how vectors can be compared using measures like cosine similarity is helpful.
- Basic data structures - You should be comfortable working with dictionaries, lists of dictionaries, and maybe even a bit of NumPy. Pandas is commonly used in this area, but it's not required to get started.
- User behaviour concepts - Recommendation systems are fundamentally about user preferences. Having a basic sense of how people interact with content through likes, watches, purchases, or skips, helps you think about the kinds of signals a recommender might use.
## Resources - What to learn and where
### 1. **Python Programming**

Most practical work in recommendation systems is done in Python because of its wide ecosystem of data science libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. You should know basic python syntax and programming constructs like functions, selection and iteration; how to work with data structures like lists and dictionaries; read from files or APIs, and using libraries.

- W3Schools python tutorial - https://www.w3schools.com/python/

- Sci-kit user guide - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html

### 2. **Basic Linear Algebra**

Many algorithms behind recommendation systems rely on operations like dot products, vectors, and matrices. Understanding how matrices work (especially in terms of representing users and items) is important. For collaborative and content based filtering you need to know matrix decomposition for filling spaces in not yet seen content for the user.

### 3. **Working with Data**

Knowing how to clean, manipulate, and analyse datasets in order to prepare suitable data to work with is crucial. Many recommendation systems are built on logs of user interactions, so you’ll need to filter, group, and reshape data before feeding it into models. It is also useful to know how to find appropriate data to build an initial dataset.

### 4. **Intro to Machine Learning Concepts**

Understanding the underlying machine learning concepts behind your project will give you a greater understanding of what is going on instead of blindly using the the library methods. 
This will let you take greater control and find more efficient solutions in your project. Examples of concepts you will learn include regression, model training, decomposition techniques like SVD and ALS, and will build a foundation more advanced machine learning projects in the future like building neural networks.

### 5. **How Recommendation Systems Work**

It's important to understand the basis of the kinds of recommendation systems you'll be using and the techniques behind them, like similarity ratings using cosine similarity. You can also learn from someone who has built a similar project and applying it in your own way.

- **Content-based filtering**: recommends items similar to those a user already liked.

- **Collaborative filtering**: uses data from many users to identify patterns and make suggestions.
    
- **Hybrid methods**: combine both approaches for better accuracy and covers more cases like new users or new content outside your dataset.

With these resources, a complete beginner can learn how recommendation systems work, the maths and concepts behind it and build their own system.

## Evaluation 

Learning how to build recommendation systems is a very rewarding skill to pick up if you’re interested in tech, data, or user experience.

### How useful is it?

Recommendation systems are everywhere from Netflix and Amazon to TikTok and Spotify. If you've ever been shown a product, song, or video that felt exactly right for you, that was probably thanks to a recommender. Understanding how this works means you can build smarter, more engaging apps that people actually want to use.

Even basic knowledge can help you stand out in job applications or personal projects. And the skills you learn like analysing user behaviour, working with large datasets, and building simple machine learning models transfer to a lot of other areas in tech.

### How hard is it?

It depends on where you’re starting. Here's a quick idea of what you'll need to know:

- **Python** - You should be comfortable with functions, lists, and dictionaries. Python is a simple language so these skills can be picked up very quickly.
- **Data handling** - You’ll work a lot with CSVs or large JSON files, so knowing how to read and clean data is important.
- **Maths** - Some mathematical knowledge of vectors, matrices, and inner products are helpful to understand how the algorithms work. 
- **Machine learning libraries** – Tools like NumPy, Pandas, or Scikit-learn can simplify the process a lot.    

If you're already familiar with Python and basic data handling, it will be a lot easier.

### Are there easier alternatives?

If you're not ready to dive all the way into recommendation systems, there are simpler paths you could try first:

- **Data visualisation** – Explore trends in user data without building a model.
- **Search systems** – Search systems are also used everywhere like google and app stores, and there is more to it than just comparing strings, so it can be interesting to explore.
- **User analytics** – Looking at how people behave in apps or on websites, without needing machine learning.

But if you’re curious about how apps know what you like, recommender systems are one of the best skills you can learn.
